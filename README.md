# text_generator
The program that generates random sentences using the words from the big text file.

You take the big text file ("War and Piece", for example), put it into the current directory, then launch the program and print the name of this file.

The program will genereate random sentences that make some sense.

For example:

But you are a beauty.
Step aside, country boy. People working here.
I have a son, you have to?
A captured wildling swears their tribes are the bastard, though.
Yes, Father. I'm the First Men … Father will know if you do.
And I know I broke my oath.
I'll tell you, dwarf. A bastard boy with nothing to be afraid of until you told father.
One is frightened of the House Baratheon, first of his name … Don't look away.
The one who pulled you from my country?
That's true. You're still a boy forever.
